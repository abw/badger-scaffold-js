# badger-scaffold

This is a scaffolding tool for creating a new Javascript module.

I wrote it to help me bootstrap a new Javascript module with all the
modules, configuration files and other paraphernalia that I happen to
like:

* vite
* vitest
* eslint

At the moment it has just one template, `react-lib`, for creating a new
React library.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/abw/badger-scaffold-js.git
```

Install the dependencies

```bash
$ cd badger-scaffold-js
$ pnpm install
```

Run the script.  The `-h` or `--help` option displays the help.
