# scaffold-js

This is a scaffolding tool for creating a new Javascript module.

I wrote it to help me bootstrap a new Javascript module with all the
modules, configuration files and other paraphernalia that I happen to
like

Note that it was written as a tool for me to use, rather than a general
purpose tool for other people to use.  You're welcome to use it, but you
may find things have been set up for my own situation and preferences.

## Running With npx

You can run the scaffold script using `npx`.

```bash
$ npx @abw/scaffold
```

Add the `-h` or `--help` option for help.

```bash
$ npx @abw/scaffold -h
```
